                Due to the large amount of civilians fleeing their respective countries, the Lebanese government lacks the resources to provide services at the required scale. This is where UHR comes in; through our various programs and campaigns, you can help making a positive impact on your brothers and sisters in Lebanon.

                Eid is a special time of year. Not just for Muslims, but many people around the world are receiving the benefits of Eid. 
                Why? Because during Eid, there is an emphasis on charitable giving for the needy and the vulnerable. It promotes empathy, care, and concern through the act of sacrifice (Udhiya/Qurbani).
